## Intro

This is very basic prototype of a search application that allows users to search for businesses and people as part of their investigations. The user is provided with a rudimentary UI which dynamically load results from the backend.


## Getting started

1. Use the version of Node that is specified in the `.nvmrc` file at the root of this project.
2. Make sure you have [yarn v1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) installed for dependency management.
3. Run `yarn` in the project root to install all dependencies.
4. Run `yarn start-api` to start the mock API.
5. Run `yarn start`.
6. The client application should load in your browser automatically, but if not then check your terminal for the URL and load it manually.
